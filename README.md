This repo contains a client side pre-commit and pre-push script that prevent you from commiting to the master branch directly.

It also prevent you from pushing your master branch to the origin repo.

It forces you to get into the good habit of always work on a branch and open a pull request to merge into master which allows code reviews to happend.
